# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

## Overview

This is the repository done for the "Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning" talk for Quito's AI event in Impaqto.

This project was built with Kedro setup using the version `kedro 0.19.5`.

Take a look at the [Kedro documentation](https://docs.kedro.org) to get started.

## About my self.

I am SebastiÃ¡n Sarasti. I have worked as data scientist and machine learning engineer for almost 3 years in the industry. 
Since 5 years ago, I got amazed by data science and AI world since 2019. From this point, I applied machine learning and
data science for many of my projects in the academia.

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a [data engineering convention](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/faq/faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention)
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `requirements.txt` for `pip` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project dependencies

To see and update the dependency requirements for your project use `requirements.txt`. Install the project requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `catalog`, `context`, `pipelines` and `session`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.
